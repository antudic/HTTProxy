SQLite DB: 
    Every proxy.
    Proxy ip address + port: (string presumably)
    isWorking: (bool/bit) 
    lastChecked: datetime

Redis: 
    Every isWorking Proxy.
    Proxy ip address + port: (string presumably)
    lastUsed: timestamp
    lock: (bool/bit) <- indicates if it's currently being used
    latency: int (ms)

Application (program):
    Passive thread:
        Go through the SQLite proxies and re-check proxies that do not work
        Move working proxies to the Redis DB

    Active thread:
        Make requests using an appropriate proxy
            Updating the lastUsed timestamp, lock, and latency
        Remove proxies from the Redis DB and update the SQLite entry to isWorking=false
